# Feature: Add Spacetime Database

**Created:** 2025-12-21
**Owner:** Michael
**Discovery Phase:** not_started

## Description

[What should be built and why - provide context for the team]

## BDD Scenarios

### User Persona
Developer building the heycat app who needs a robust data persistence and synchronization layer. Technically proficient with the codebase and looking to integrate SpacetimeDB as the foundational data layer.

### Problem Statement
The app currently lacks adequate data persistence and synchronization capabilities. SpacetimeDB will provide:
- Local data persistence that survives across sessions
- Real-time sync capabilities for reactive data updates
- Multi-device synchronization for users across different machines
- Live multiplayer collaboration features

This is a foundational feature - other features depend on having this data layer in place. The current storage solution is insufficient, and SpacetimeDB enables new collaborative capabilities that weren't previously possible.
