# Feature: View Recordings

**Created:** 2025-12-01
**Owner:** Michael
**Discovery Phase:** not_started

## Description

[What should be built and why - provide context for the team]

## BDD Scenarios

### User Persona
General user with average technical proficiency who creates recordings in heycat and needs to access them later.

### Problem Statement
Users can record audio but have no way to view or access their recordings within the app. Currently they must manually navigate to the app data folder to find recordings. This is a core part of the recording lifecycle - without viewing capability, the recording feature is incomplete.
